"# go-redis"
- based on key-value
- the data will be stored as pair (key-value)
- we can set the redis to stored in the disk, but when we access the redis data, redis will serve with the data in the memory 
- the disk data used for backup only
- when we used redis
    - slow database
        - first you should try to tuning the db (put indexing, improve query performance, etc)
        - if not improved so much, try to use redis as db caching
        - the flow:
            - client make a request
            - app server check redis cache:
                - if cache hit, return cached data
                - if cache miss, quer the database
            - save DB result to redis for future request
            - return data to the client    
    - slow the third party apllication 
    - heavy app process
